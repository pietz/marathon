## Tobi
- First-time marathon runner
- Doesn't look the sportiest on the outside

- The type to surprise everyone on race day
- TODO: collect more trivia (favorite training excuse? pre-race ritual?)

## Kevin
- First-time marathon runner
- Famously the LAST person to show up when someone needs help moving
- Reliability rating: questionable
- Will he even show up to the starting line on time?
- TODO: collect more trivia (does he have a training plan? what's his excuse?)

## Jonas
- First-time marathon runner
- The nice doctor of the group
- Probably the one who'll be checking everyone's vitals at the finish line
- Medical advantage: actually understands what his body is doing
- TODO: collect more trivia (specialty? running form? does he prescribe himself rest days?)

## Alex
- THE ONLY ONE who has actually run a marathon before
- Real age: 38. Official group age: 45.
- Age jokes are fair game and encouraged
- The veteran, the "old man" of the group
- Has actual experience, which either helps or adds pressure
